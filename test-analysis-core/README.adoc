= Test Analysis
:toc:

== Features

* Collection of scalar xref:#metrics[test metrics].
* _Sliding window_ of a configurable size.
* xref:#algorithms[Test analysis].

[#metrics]
=== Test Metrics

* The number of successful runs;
* The number of failures;
* The number of status "flips" (i.e. "success -> failure" and "failure -> success"
transitions across consecutive test runs);
* Failure rate;
* Flip rate;
* Average test duration;
* Median test duration.

[#algorithms]
=== Algorithms

* _Flaky test_ detection based on _flip rate_ (the default threshold is *30%*).
* _Regression_ detection.
