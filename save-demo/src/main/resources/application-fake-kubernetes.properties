# Do not forget that this is a tricky way to test kubernetes stuff running save-demo outside the kubernetes
# Keep in mind that there should be port-forwarding for minio (9000) in order to let pod download from s3 storage
# There surely are better ways to debug it, but as a temporary solution it is good enough

# To get this port you should run this command:
#   $ docker port minikube
# And find the following line:
#   8443/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:XXXX
# Here, XXXX is a requested port
demo.kubernetes.apiServerUrl=https://127.0.0.1:61234
demo.kubernetes.serviceAccount=demo-sa
demo.kubernetes.namespace=save-cloud
demo.kubernetes.useGvisor=false
demo.kubernetes.agentSubdomainName=save-demo-agent
demo.kubernetes.agentPort=23456

# Here you also might need to set port-forwarding
demo.agent-config.demo-url=http://host.minikube.internal:5421

# TODO: Need to come up with an idea how and what to do with s3 url
#  as from kubernetes it is expected to be http://host.minikube.internal:9000 instead of http://localhost:9000
# Naive way (replacing localhost with host.minikube.internal doesn't work: 403 on download attempt)
