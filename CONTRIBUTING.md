## Launching save-cloud with command line
1. Use `gradlew.bat startMysqlDb` on Windows and `./gradlew startMysqlDb` on other platforms for setting up database.
Make sure you have Docker installed and active.
2. Run backend.
It can be run either with `./gradlew save-backend:bootRun` or with Intellij Idea Ultimate plugin from the menu `Services`.
3. Run frontend. It can be run with `./gradlew save-frontend:run`.
You can enable hot reload by passing `--continuous` flag.
4. More specific instructions can be found in [save-deploy](save-deploy/README.md)

## Spring Intellij Idea Ultimate plugin
In order to make Spring Intellij Idea Ultimate plugin work properly, you need to set these active profiles in service's configuration:  

|         | SaveApplication  | SaveGateway |   SaveOrchestrator   | SavePreprocessor |     SaveSandbox      |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
|   Mac   | `mac,dev,secure` |  `mac,dev`  | `dev,mac,docker-tcp` |    `dev,mac`     | `dev,mac,docker-tcp` | 
| Windows |   `dev,secure`   |    `dev`    | `dev,win,docker-tcp` |    `dev,win`     | `dev,win,docker-tcp` |
|  Linux  |   `dev,secure`   |    `dev`    |   `dev,docker-tcp`   |      `dev`       |   `dev,docker-tcp`   |

### Mac M1 contributors
In file `save-cloud/build.gradle.kts` change languageVersion of `org.liquibase.gradle.LiquibaseTask` from 11 to 17
so there would be something like this:
```
tasks.withType<org.liquibase.gradle.LiquibaseTask>().configureEach {
    this.javaLauncher.set(project.extensions.getByType<JavaToolchainService>().launcherFor {
        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(17))
    })
}
```
In order to run `save-orchestrator` on Mac with M1 in order to make it run executions, in addition to `save-deploy/README.md` you need to 
1. manually put all the files from `save-agent-*-distribution.jar` into `save-orchestrator/build/resources/main` as well as `save-*-linuxX64.kexe` (temporary workaround) 
2. run `docker-mac-settings.sh` script (from `save-deploy` folder) in order to let docker be available via TCP 
Also check `save-deploy/README.md` for extra information
