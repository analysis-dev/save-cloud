val schemaVersionDescr = """
    The `schema_version` field is used to indicate which version
    of the COSV schema a particular vulnerability was exported with.
    This can help consumer applications decide how to import the data for
    their own systems and offer some protection against future breaking changes.
    The value should be a string matching the COSV schema version,
    which follows
    the [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) format, with no leading “v” prefix.
    If no value is specified, it should be assumed to be `1.0.0`,
    matching version `1.0` of the COSV schema.
