# SAVE Cloud deployment configuration
## Components
SAVE Cloud contains the following microservices:
* backend: REST API for DB
* test-preprocessor: clones projects for test and discovers tests
* orchestrator: moderates distributed execution of tests, feeds new batches of tests to a set of agents
save-cloud uses MySQL as a database. Liquibase (via gradle plugin) is used for schema initialization and migration.

## Building
* Prerequisites: some components require additional system packages. See [save-agent](../save-agent/README.md) description for details.
  save-frontend requires node.js installation.
* To build the project and run all tests, execute `./gradlew build`.
* For deployment, all microservices are packaged as docker images with the version based on latest git tag and latest commit hash, if there are commits after tag.

Deployment is performed on server via docker swarm or locally via docker-compose. See detailed information below.

## Server deployment
* Server should run Linux and support docker swarm and gvisor runtime. Ideally, kernel 5.+ is required.
* [reverse-proxy.conf](reverse-proxy.conf) is a configuration for Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for save-cloud. It should be 
  copied into `/etc/nginx/sites-available`.
* Gvisor should be installed and runsc runtime should be available for docker. See [installation guide](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/) for details.
  A different runtime can be specified with `orchestrator.docker.runtime` property in orchestrator.
* Ensure that docker daemon is running and that docker is in swarm mode.
* Secrets should be added to the swarm as well as to `$HOME/secrets` file.
* If custom SSL certificates are used, they should be installed on the server and added into JDK's truststore inside images. See section below for details.
* Loki logging driver should be added to docker installation: [instruction](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/#installing)
* Pull new changes to the server and run `./gradlew -Psave.profile=prod deployDockerStack`.
  * If you wish to deploy save-cloud, that is not present in docker registry (e.g. to deploy from a branch), run `./gradlew -Psave.profile=prod buildAndDeployDockerStack` instead.
  * If you would like to use `docker-compose.override.yaml`, add `-PuseOverride=true` to the execution of tasks above
* [`docker-compose.yaml.template`](../docker-compose.yaml.template) is configured so that all services use Loki for logging
  and configuration files from `~/configs`, which are copied from `save-deploy` during gradle build.

## Override configuration per server
If you wish to customize services configuration externally (i.e. leaving docker images intact), this is possible via additional properties files.
In [docker-compose.yaml.template](../docker-compose.yaml.template) all services have `/home/saveu/configs/<service name>` directory mounted. If it contains
`application.properties` file, it will override config from default `application.properties`.

## Running behind proxy
If save-cloud is running behind proxy, docker daemon should be configured to use proxy. See [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/).
Additionally, use `/home/saveu/configs/orchestrator/application.properties` to add two flags to `apt-get`:
```properties
orchestrator.aptExtraFlags=-o Acquire::http::proxy="http://host.docker.internal:3128" -o Acquire::https::proxy="http://host.docker.internal:3128"
```
Proxy URLs will be resolved from inside the container.

## Custom SSL certificates
If custom SSL certificates are used, they should be installed on the server and added into JDK's truststore inside images.
One way of adding them into JDK is to mount them in docker-compose.yaml and then override default command:
```yaml
preprocessor:
  volume:
    - '/path/to/certs/cert.cer:/home/cnb/cert.cer'
  entrypoint: /bin/bash
  command: -c 'find /layers -name jre -type d -exec {}/bin/keytool -keystore {}/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -trustcacerts -importcert -alias <cert-alias> -file /home/cnb/cert.cer \; && /cnb/process/web'
```

## Database
The service is designed to work with MySQL database. Migrations are applied with liquibase. They expect event scheduler to be enabled on the DB.

## Local deployment
* Ensure that docker daemon is running and docker-compose is installed.
* To make things easier, add line `save.profile=dev` to `gradle.properties`. This will make project version `SNAPSHOT` instead of timetamp-based suffix and allow caching of gradle tasks.
* Run `./gradlew deployLocal -Psave.profile=dev` to start the database and microservices.

#### Note:
If a snapshot version of save-cli is required (i.e., the one which is not available on GitHub releases), then it can be
manually placed in `save-orchestrator/build/resources/main` before build, and it's version should be provided via `-PsaveCliVersion=...` when executing gradle.

## Ports allocation
| port | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 3306 | database (locally) |
| 5000 | save-backend |
| 5100 | save-orchestrator |
| 5200 | save-test-preprocessor |
| 6000 | local docker registry (not used currently) |
| 9090 | prometheus |
| 9091 | node_exporter |
| 9100 | grafana |

## Secrets
* Liquibase is reading secrets from the secrets file located on the server in the `home` directory.
* PostProcessor is reading secrets for database connection from the docker secrets and fills the spring datasource. (DockerSecretsDatabaseProcessor class)

# Server configuration
## Nginx
Nginx is used as a reverse proxy, which allows access from external network to backend and some other services.
File `save-deploy/reverse-proxy.conf` should be copied to `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. Symlink should be created:
`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` (or to `/etc/nginx/conf.d` on some distributions).
