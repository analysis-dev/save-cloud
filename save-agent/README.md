# Building
Read the [official docs](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native#kotlinnative) and install all dependencies listed in 'Prerequisites' section.

On windows you'll also need to install msys2 and run `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-curl` to have libcurl for ktor-client.
On ubuntu install `libcrul4-openssl-dev`.
